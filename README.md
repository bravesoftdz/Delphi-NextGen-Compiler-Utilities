#Delphi NextGen Compiler Utilities

Delphi for Mobiles comes with a new compiler. This Repository is for me to share any Library code I have used to help port existing Old Compiler code 
to the Next Gen Compiler. The Delphi NextGen compiler does not support AnsiString and I needed this feature so the first Library Published relates to an ANSI String Solution.
