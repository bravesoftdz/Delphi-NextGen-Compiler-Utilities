#Delphi NextGen Compiler Utilities

Delphi for Mobiles comes with a new compiler. This Repository is for me to share any Library code I have used to help port existing Old Compiler code to the Next Gen Compiler. 

##Ansistring, PAnsiChar and AnsiChar

The Delphi NextGen compiler does not support AnsiString and I needed this feature so the first *Library* published relates to an ANSI String Solution. The code here uses *Class Operators* to implement **AnsiString** record types on NextGen platforms. More details http://delphinotes.innovasolutions.com.au/posts/ansistring-on-an-android-device
